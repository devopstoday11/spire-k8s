# Spire-K8s

This repo contains code and artifacts to integrate SPIRE and Kubernetes.

Integration goals include:

* Automatic injection of SPIRE sidecar containers in workloads deployed in the Kubernetes cluster
* Automatic mounting of a hostpath volume in sidecar container with a UDS where the workload API is exposed
* Automatic programming of entries in the SPIRE server for new workloads
* Establishing trust between SPIRE agent and SPIRE server using a Kubernetes-signed identity document

The design is being discussed in this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14PFWpKHbXLxJwPn9NYYcUWGyO9d8HE1H_XAZ4Tz5K0E/edit)
